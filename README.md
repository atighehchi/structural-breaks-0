This is a crude, preliminary attempt to bring together a number of different methods of changepoint detection in an integrated fashion.
Note: This is not a working version and does not produce the expected results. This is only to archive the methodological approach.

This is an experiment and exploration of the methodology and as such is a mix of vibe coding and manual implementation.

We began with a set of high-level questions that guided our dive:
•	Definition and scope of changepoints/structural breaks:
→ “What is a changepoint really, across fields?”

•	Complications in detection:
→ “What about trends, seasonality, mean reversion — do they distort detection? When does it matter (diagnostic vs. forecasting)?”

•	Gradual vs. abrupt changes:
→ “If change isn’t instantaneous but unfolds over timesteps, how is that treated? Is it still a ‘break’?”

•	Framings / structuring of detection:
→ “What are the main families of methods, how do they ‘think’ about change? Sliding windows vs. global fits vs. sequential monitoring?”

•	Distortions and confounds:
→ “What else could look like a break but isn’t (nonlinearities, data artifacts, local changes, etc.)?”

•	Preprocessing, reclocking, unit of observation:
→ “What if we redefine the time unit or aggregation? Can we detect breaks better if we change how the clock ticks?”

•	Domain-agnostic vs. domain-specific validity:
→ “How reliable are reclocking or preprocessing tricks if I don’t know the data’s context (finance vs. seismology vs. biology)?”

####

We expand into a multi-dimensional view of changepoint detection:

(A) Conceptual foundations
•	Structural break = usually treated as point-like, but may be gradual.
•	Different fields emphasize different analogies: finance (policy regime), climate (trend shifts), biology (mutation events).

(B) Distortions / confounds in detection
Seven categories we mapped out:
1.	Trends / drifts – long-run shifts can masquerade as breaks.
2.	Seasonality / cyclicity – periodic changes mistaken as regime change.
3.	Mean reversion / persistence – temporary shocks may be over-read as structural.
4.	Nonlinearities / thresholds – hidden regime-switch dynamics produce break-like patterns.
5.	Data issues / artifacts – sensor errors, reporting lags, market closures.
6.	Multi-scale structure – micro vs. macro breaks.
7.	Gradual vs. abrupt change – fuzzy boundaries between break and trend.

(C) Structuring detection families
Three overarching families:
1.	Window-based / local comparisons – sliding tests of before vs. after.
2.	Global model-fitting – segmenting whole series via likelihood or penalties.
3.	Sequential monitoring – online detection, CUSUM/SPRT type.
Each has different strengths and vulnerabilities to distortions.

(D) Gradual change vs. trend
•	Distinguishing “slow break” from “trend” depends on assumptions:
•	Break = regime with a new stationary state after change.
•	Trend = continuous evolution, no return to stability.
•	Possible strategies:
•	Fit trend models + test residuals for breakpoints.
•	Multi-resolution detection (look at different scales).
•	Hybrid models (trend + changepoint in slope).

(E) Reclocking & unit change
•	Beyond rescaling: redefining the “clock” itself (event-time, volatility-time, CUSUM transforms).
•	Domain-agnostic: generic statistical reclocking (cumulative sums, block means).
•	Domain-specific: semantic clocks (volume bars in markets, stress release in seismology).
•	Concern: reliability if domain is unknown → safest to stay with purely statistical transformations.


To deepen our search, here are related dimensions worth considering:
1.	Evaluation perspective
•	Diagnostic vs. predictive uses: when is it enough to mark a break, and when do you need to forecast post-break dynamics?
2.	Model robustness
•	How do methods behave under misspecification (e.g. heavy tails, nonlinear DGPs)?
•	How sensitive are they to window size, penalty choice, or tuning parameters?
3.	Multi-resolution & hierarchical detection
•	Many systems exhibit nested breaks (small/local vs. large/global).
•	How to design methods that catch both without confusing one for the other?
4.	Uncertainty quantification
•	Not just “where is the break” but “with what confidence?”
•	Especially relevant for forecasting tasks.
5.	Synthetic vs. empirical testing
•	Benchmark on artificial series (controlled distortions) vs. messy real data (domain-unknown).
6.	Cross-disciplinary analogies
•	Finance (policy shift, liquidity regime).
•	Climate (abrupt shift in mean temperature).
•	Genomics (copy number variation).
•	Epidemiology (disease spread acceleration).
•	Each field has unique ways to reconcile gradual vs abrupt, trend vs regime.

####

Here's a structured view of the method families to cover all grounds. We start with this:

[Perspective	Core Intuition / Narrative	How It Differs from Fitted-Model Perspective	Treatment of DGP / Implication]
Regime / State Shift	System exists in multiple states; break occurs when the system moves to a new state	Doesn’t rely on past model fit; focuses on a qualitative change in state	DGP is piecewise: each regime has its own generating process; break = transition between DGPs
Force-Driven / Causal Change	Real-world forces (inputs, policies, shocks) change	Focus is on causes, not on model fit; break is evidence of external force change	DGP parameters are altered by exogenous or endogenous forces; break reflects new causal structure
Threshold / Boundary-Crossing	System behaves continuously until a critical point; break occurs after crossing	Fitted-model may not anticipate non-linear thresholds; break is about system non-linearity	DGP is non-linear; break emerges from reaching a critical point, not misfit of linear model
Surprise / Anomaly	A disruptive event changes system behavior	Focus on unexpected events, not gradual model misfit	DGP changes abruptly due to rare or exogenous shocks; may create transient or permanent regime change
Process / Mechanism Change	The process generating data itself changes	Doesn’t rely on past model fitting; break is change in rules/mechanisms	DGP itself is altered; new process replaces or modifies old one; not just parameter shift
Information / Knowledge Update	Break occurs when agents’ understanding of the system changes	Break is driven by perception, not past fit	DGP may be the same objectively, but effective DGP (observed outcomes) shifts because behavior or expectations change
Interaction / Network Change	Break arises from changes in relationships among system components	Break is systemic, not single-variable misfit	DGP becomes higher-order: correlations, dependencies, or network effects change, generating new emergent behavior
Structural Fragility / Instability	Small shocks trigger large changes due to system’s instability	Fitted-model may not capture tipping points; break is endogenous	DGP is sensitive/non-linear; break is amplification of latent vulnerabilities, not misfit per se
Regime-Contingent Expectations / Behavioral Change	Break occurs because collective expectations/behavior change	Break is about agent coordination, not past statistical fit	DGP changes as a result of endogenous behavior adaptation, not purely from external shocks

Then refine to this:

[Perspective / Flavour	Core Idea	Conceptual Distinction from “generic fitted-model”	Quantitative Approach (Univariate)	Type of DGP Change Detected]
Fitted-model: mean/level-based	Break occurs when mean level of series shifts	Focuses only on level changes	CUSUM, Chow test, rolling mean comparison	Shift in mean of DGP
Fitted-model: variance-based	Break occurs when variability changes	Focuses on second moment, not level	Rolling variance, GARCH parameter shifts, CUSUM of squares	Shift in variance/volatility of DGP
Fitted-model: autocorrelation / dynamics-based	Break occurs when temporal dependence changes	Focuses on autocorrelation structure or ARMA parameters	Recursive estimation of ARMA coefficients, residual diagnostics	Change in temporal dependence structure of DGP
Threshold / boundary-crossing	Break occurs when series crosses a critical value triggering new dynamics	Not defined by past fit; break triggered by hitting threshold	Threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, piecewise regression, change-point in level crossings	Non-linear DGP shifts triggered by observed value
Structural fragility / instability	Break arises from internal amplification of small shocks	Focus on emergent instability rather than fit misalignment	Early warning indicators: variance, autocorrelation, skewness over rolling windows	DGP exhibits critical transitions or tipping points
Regime / behavioral-like (Markov-switching univariate)	Series shifts between latent states with different properties	Detects shifts in latent structure, not just residual misfit	Univariate Markov-switching models, hidden Markov models	DGP switches between latent regimes with different parameters
Interaction/network perspective	Not applicable in univariate series	Requires multivariate data; cannot operate on single series	N/A	N/A
Force-driven / causal perspective	Not applicable in univariate series without exogenous input	Needs external driver information	N/A	N/A
Surprise / anomaly perspective	Could be implemented as extreme deviations from prior distribution	Uses probabilistic surprise rather than model misfit	Outlier detection, extreme value analysis, sequential probability ratio test	Rare or extreme events in DGP, may coincide with level/variance shifts


And eventually to this --to be univariate, online and domain-agnostic:

[Perspective / Flavour	Core Idea	Conceptual Distinction from Generic Fitted-Model	Key Focus / What It Looks For	Conceptual Diagnostic Approach	Issues / Caveats	Checks / Measures for Reliability]
Fitted-model: mean / level	Break occurs when the series’ average shifts	Focuses on persistent deviation from historical mean; residual-based	Change in mean	Examine residuals over time; persistent nonzero mean indicates a shift	Misspecification of baseline mean; gradual changes may be hard to detect	Confidence intervals on mean, rolling z-scores, Bayesian credible intervals for mean estimate
Fitted-model: variance / volatility	Break occurs when variability changes	Focuses on second moment rather than level; residual-based	Change in variance	Monitor residual heteroscedasticity or rolling variance; sustained change indicates break	Volatility clustering may mimic a break; extreme outliers may distort variance	Rolling variance confidence intervals, t- or F-statistics for variance comparison, bootstrap variance estimates
Fitted-model: autocorrelation / dynamics	Break occurs when temporal dependence structure changes	Looks at lag correlations or ARMA parameters; residual-based	Change in autocorrelation or lagged relationships	Examine residual autocorrelation over rolling windows; systematic changes indicate break	Small sample sizes may bias autocorrelation; slow gradual shifts may be missed	Confidence intervals on autocorrelations, rolling AR parameter intervals, Ljung-Box type diagnostics
Threshold / boundary-crossing	Break occurs when series crosses critical values triggering new dynamics	Not defined by past model fit; break triggered by hitting threshold	Observed values relative to critical thresholds	Identify points where series exceeds/falls below threshold and exhibits different behavior	Choice of threshold can be arbitrary; slow approaches may be ambiguous	Probabilistic thresholds (historical percentiles), rolling z- or t-scores relative to mean/variance, sensitivity analysis to threshold
Structural fragility / instability	System becomes sensitive; small shocks are amplified	Focus on latent system sensitivity rather than residual misfit	Early-warning signs: rising variance, autocorrelation, skewness	Track variance, autocorrelation, skewness over rolling windows; trends signal fragility	Small sample noise may mimic instability; false positives are possible	Rolling window confidence intervals, bootstrapped estimates, comparison with stochastic null models
Regime / latent-state (Markov-switching)	Series shifts between unobserved states with distinct properties	Breaks due to latent state change, not residual misfit	Periods with distinct mean, variance, or autocorrelation	Assess whether series exhibits clusters of statistically distinct behavior over time	Number of states may be misestimated; short regimes may be hard to detect	Posterior probabilities of states, likelihood-based confidence, sensitivity to assumed number of states
Surprise / anomaly	Break occurs via rare or extreme deviations	Focus on extreme events rather than persistent misfit	Observations far from historical patterns	Identify unusually large deviations from past distribution; extreme observations signal break	Extreme outliers may be noise; multiple comparisons may inflate false positives	Z- or t-scores for extreme values, probability of exceedance, rolling quantiles, bootstrap of extreme statistics

This also should consider global v local and model-free v model-based (so we deal with fitting which raises complexity and risk of errors) approaches.

####

We summarise our approach as:

Step 0: Input & Preprocessing
•	Input: raw univariate series (sequential, online).
•	Preprocessing tasks:
o	Detrending / normalization: remove long-term trends or normalize scale to avoid spurious detections. Methods may include rolling z-scores or differencing.
o	De-seasonalization / cyclicality removal: identify and remove strong periodic components if present.
o	Smoothing / noise reduction (optional): lightweight filters to reduce high-frequency noise without losing break points.
•	Output: cleaned / normalized series ready for analysis.
________________________________________
Step 1: Outlier / Shock Handling
•	Objective: detect extreme single-step deviations that may bias break detection.
•	Design:
o	Detect shocks via rolling statistics (e.g., deviation from rolling median / variance).
o	Flag separately or feed into perspectives as part of “surprise/anomaly” branch.
•	Scoring: probabilistic score = deviation magnitude relative to rolling or historical variance.
________________________________________
Step 2: Perspective-Specific Detection Modules
•	Objective: multiple complementary “views” on potential breaks.
•	Modules:
Perspective Module	Conceptual Approach	Notes
Residual (Mean/Variance/Autocorr)	Fit short-term predictive models (rolling mean, rolling variance, AR for autocorrelation). Breaks flagged if residuals deviate beyond expectation.	Captures level, volatility, and dependence structure changes.
Threshold	Monitor distribution tails; detect unusual extremes relative to empirical distribution.	Simple, robust; aligns with anomaly detection methods.
Fragility	Monitor stability of fitted model parameters; detect when model fit degrades.	Approximates concept of system near a tipping point.
Latent-State	Sequential latent models (HMM, online clustering, change-point priors). Detect if the system is better explained by a new hidden state.	More complex; allows regime switches.
Surprise / Anomaly	Pointwise anomaly detection via rolling z-score, percentile ranks, or predictive uncertainty.	Quick, online, aligns with intuitive "unexpectedness."
•	Outputs: each perspective produces:
o	Probability of break ∈ [0,1], where 1 = break.
o	(Optional) confidence/reliability score of its own detection.

Perspective / Flavour	Core Idea	Conceptual Distinction from Generic Fitted-Model	Key Focus / What It Looks For	Conceptual Diagnostic Approach	Issues / Caveats	Checks / Measures for Reliability
Fitted-model: mean / level	Break occurs when the series’ average shifts	Focuses on persistent deviation from historical mean; directly checks residuals	Change in mean	Examine residuals over time; persistent nonzero mean indicates a shift	Misspecification of baseline mean; gradual change may be hard to detect	Confidence intervals on mean, rolling z-scores, Bayesian credible intervals for mean estimate
Fitted-model: variance / volatility	Break occurs when variability changes	Focuses on second moment rather than level	Change in variance	Monitor residual heteroscedasticity or rolling variance; sustained change indicates break	Volatility clustering may be mistaken for a break; extreme outliers may distort variance	Rolling variance confidence intervals, t- or F-statistics for variance comparison, bootstrapped variance estimates
Fitted-model: autocorrelation / dynamics	Break occurs when temporal dependence structure changes	Looks at lag correlations or ARMA parameters; still residual-based	Change in autocorrelation or lagged relationships	Examine residual autocorrelation over rolling windows; systematic changes indicate break	Small sample sizes may bias autocorrelation; slow gradual shifts may be missed	Confidence intervals on autocorrelations, Ljung-Box type statistics, rolling AR parameter intervals
Threshold / boundary-crossing	Break occurs when series crosses critical thresholds that trigger new behavior	Not defined by past model fit; break is triggered by hitting threshold	Observed values relative to critical thresholds	Identify points where series exceeds/falls below threshold and exhibits different behavior	Choice of threshold can be arbitrary; slow threshold approaches may be ambiguous	Probabilistic thresholds using historical percentiles, z- or t-scores relative to mean and variance, sensitivity analysis to threshold
Structural fragility / instability	System becomes sensitive; small shocks lead to large changes	Focus on emergent system sensitivity rather than residual misfit	Early signs of latent instability: rising variance, autocorrelation, skewness	Track variance, autocorrelation, skewness over rolling windows; detect trends signaling fragility	Small sample noise may mimic instability; early-warning signals can be false positives	Rolling window confidence intervals, bootstrap estimates, comparison with null stochastic simulations
Regime / latent-state	Series switches between unobserved states with distinct properties	Breaks are due to shifts in latent states, not just				

________________________________________

Step 3: Score Normalization & Aggregation
•	Objective: unify signals from perspectives into one probability per point.
•	Options:
o	Weighted sum / average (weights = reliability scores).
o	Maximum score (if any perspective strongly signals a break).
o	Bayesian pooling / probabilistic integration (preferred default for rigor).
•	Output: single break probability ∈ [0,1].
________________________________________
Step 4: Output
•	For each new point:
o	Final probability of break.
o	Perspective-specific scores (for transparency / explainability).
o	Optional alert if probability exceeds threshold.
________________________________________
Step 5: Post-Processing / Optional Smoothing
•	Objective: stabilize outputs in noisy environments.
•	Options:
o	Rolling smoothing or exponential smoothing of aggregated probability.
o	Hysteresis / persistence rules (e.g., require N consecutive high-prob signals).
o	Adaptive thresholding to control false alarms.

####

We develop these guidelines for implementation:

1. Architecture & Structure
•	All implementations must follow the Reference Plan steps (0–5).
•	Every step is modularized (class/function).
•	Order and presence of modules must be preserved (e.g., preprocessing → shock detection → perspectives → aggregation → output → post-processing).
•	Skeleton code is authoritative: new code extends or refines it, not rewrite or bypass it.
________________________________________
2. Input/Output Rules
•	Input: raw univariate sequential data (online first, batch second).
•	Intermediate outputs:
o	Preprocessed series.
o	Shock detector flags/scores.
o	Perspective-specific probabilities.
•	Final outputs:
o	Break probability ∈ [0,1].
o	Optional perspective breakdown.
o	Optional alerts if threshold exceeded.
•	All outputs must remain probabilistic, not hard binary unless post-processed.
________________________________________
3. Preprocessing (Step 0)
•	Always include:
o	Detrending / normalization.
o	De-seasonalization / cycle removal.
o	Optional smoothing.
•	Methods must be lightweight, online-compatible (rolling stats, online filters).
•	Must not “over-clean” to the point of erasing actual breaks.
________________________________________
4. Shock Detection (Step 1)
•	Implemented immediately after preprocessing.
•	Detect extreme single-step deviations (candidate shocks).
•	Score shocks relative to rolling variance or historical scale.
•	Must integrate into:
o	Surprise/anomaly perspective (if treated as anomalies).
o	Or flagged separately (metadata).
________________________________________
5. Perspective Modules (Step 2)
•	Each perspective is its own module/class, outputs probability ∈ [0,1].
•	Must preserve the five canonical perspectives:
1.	Residual (mean, variance, autocorrelation changes).
2.	Threshold.
3.	Fragility.
4.	Latent-state.
5.	Surprise/anomaly.
•	Residual-based methods require rolling short-term models (AR, variance, etc.).
•	Latent-state approximated via lightweight online HMM or clustering (no heavy offline training unless explicitly allowed).
•	Fragility proxies: monitor stability/degradation of model fits.
•	All must produce probability in [0,1], not raw stats.
________________________________________
6. Aggregation (Step 3)
•	All perspective scores must be combined into a single break probability.
•	Methods allowed:
o	Weighted sum/average (weights = reliability).
o	Maximum rule.
o	Bayesian pooling (default where possible).
•	Aggregator must accept perspective reliability/confidence scores when available.
________________________________________
7. Post-Processing (Step 5)
•	Optional but always supported.
•	Methods allowed:
o	Rolling/exponential smoothing.
o	Hysteresis (require persistence before switching states).
o	Adaptive thresholding.
•	Must never overwrite raw probabilities — smoothing is additional output.
________________________________________
8. Coding Standards
•	Consistency with skeleton: all functions, classes, and steps exist in code.
•	Comments:
o	Each function/class has docstring: purpose, inputs, outputs, assumptions.
o	Inline comments explain reasoning and tie back to Reference Plan.
o	Must explicitly state if approximation is used instead of full method.
•	Naming:
o	Explicit, consistent (e.g., ShockDetector, ResidualPerspective, Aggregator).
•	Testing hooks:
o	Each step returns intermediate outputs for debugging.
________________________________________
9. DL / ML Readiness
•	Code must remain lightweight and modular, but DL/ML components can be plugged in later.
•	No hard-coded dependencies on DL now.
•	In Step 2 and Step 3, ensure easy swap-in of:
o	Neural nets for perspectives.
o	Learned weights for aggregation.
________________________________________
10. Invariants
•	Probabilistic outputs everywhere (0 = no break, 1 = certain break).
•	No step skipping: even trivial implementations must preserve the structure.
•	Explainability preserved: perspective-specific scores and shock flags available downstream.
•	Online-first: all methods default to sequential updating; batch is special case.
•	Code additions/patches must not silently break skeleton compliance.
________________________________________
11. Meta Rules
•	Optimizations (Numba, vectorization, pruning DL, etc.) can be applied, but must not alter logical flow.

    """
    Step 2: Residual-based perspective (fully self-explanatory commentary)

    Responsibilities:
      - Monitor short-term residual dynamics in an online/univariate series.
      - Capture three 'flavours' of potential structural breaks:
        1. Mean shift: sudden changes in the central tendency of the last window.
        2. Variance shift: abrupt change in local variability.
        3. Autocorrelation shift: change in lagged correlation structure.
      - Produce a single combined break score in [0,1] per point for the aggregator.

    Inputs (per update call):
      - x: scalar float, the new observation (online/sequential)
      - embedding: optional np.ndarray, DL embedding representing local temporal context
      - shock_score: float in [0,1], the output from ShockDetector to downweight extreme points

    Outputs:
      - combined: float in [0,1], break probability for the new point
      - Internally stores last_flavours dict for optional plotting/debugging

    DL integration:
      - embedding can be used to stabilize or contextualize residual estimates
      - currently a placeholder; user may integrate into mean/variance/AC calculations

    Dataflow and logic:
      1. Maintain a rolling buffer of last `window` points.
      2. Each update:
         a. Append new point, drop oldest if buffer exceeds window.
         b. Compute mean_shift, variance_shift, autocorr_shift scores from the buffer.
         c. Combine these scores (currently simple average) → output combined float.
         d. Store individual flavours internally (last_flavours) for debugging/plotting.
      3. Designed for online processing: one point at a time.

    Implementation guidance for independent coder:
      - Maintain buffer as list; convert to np.array for numerical calculations.
      - Use safe division (add epsilon) to avoid divide-by-zero in std/var calculations.
      - Clamp all scores to [0,1] for probability consistency.
      - Only return the combined float to be compatible with Aggregator.
      - last_flavours is optional; do not return it from update() unless plotting/debugging.
